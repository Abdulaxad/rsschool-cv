## About myself:
*I started my career at 18 as a trainee engineer. I started to study programming in 2020, but then I did not take it seriously. After graduation started working as an engineer for a local provider. After a recommendation from a friend, i again began to take an interest in programming and learned from him about RS School. Thanks to this, now I have a real chance to change my field of activity.*
